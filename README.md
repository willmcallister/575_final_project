# Geog 575 Final Project (Title TBD)


### Overview
Broadly, we are interested in combining our joint interest in urban planning with interactive mapping techniques we are learning in Geog 575. We're particularly exploring transit related ideas, but we're not limiting ourselves to just that area of planning.

We're still refining an idea but a few options are listed below.

### Team Members
 - Will McAllister
 - Ben Dimenstein

### Potential Project Topics
* Creating a **low-stress bicycle map**, inspired by the [City of Madison's Version](https://cityofmadison.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=cb7a2e78477044c19bf6a5eaa1820e38 "Madison LTS Map").
  * We see this as an opportunity to redo this app (fixing color accessibility, changing the user interface, etc.) but to also add features that are not present in this application.
  * We also take issue with some of the stress level decisions that were made
  * The City of Madison Open Data Portal has plenty of files to pull from to create an improved LTS map
  * We could also deviate from this purpose and instead make a map highlighting disconnections in bicycle infrastructure in Madison or create one centered around routing such as Vancouver's Map (below)
  * Potential sources of inspiration:
     * [Vancouver Bike Route Planner](https://vancouver.bikerouteplanner.com/)
     * [Tri-Met Transit Interactive](https://ride.trimet.org/home/)
     * [Portland Bike Interactive](https://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b51534aa6e1f4dd4ad4d83c4a084d9a6)
     * [PortlandMaps](https://www.portlandmaps.com/)
* Visualizing **nighttime lighting on the UW Madison campus**, with a potential to extend to more of the city.
  * This topic could allow us to be more creative and lean into unconventional strategies to tell a story of lighting.
* Other transit related projects:
  * An application that presents upcoming transit projects (maybe amtrak?) or shows potential new routings of a given rail line.
